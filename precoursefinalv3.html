	About Me
	</h2>
	<p>Hello there! My name is William Fowler and I am excited to be a part of the Rangers 59 Cohort at Coding Temple!</p>
	<p>I would like to share a bit about myself and my life on this page to give you all a better understanding of me as a person.</p>
	<p title="The above background photo is my old backyard">Currently, I live in Atlantic Beach, North Carolina. It's a small beach town which suits me just fine.
	<p>I was born a military brat in Irvine, California and due to my father's career, I have moved a few times throughout my life. I have lived in California, Arizona, North Carolina, and was even fortunate enough to live in Okinawa, Japan for four years.</p>
	<p>I graduated highschool in 2011 and went to North Carolina State University that fall. I studied Accounting there for two and a half years before realizing my heart was not in it and as I was responsible for paying for school, I dropped out.</p>
	<p>Upon leaving State, I moved back to the beach and picked up my old summer job of waiting tables. I was moved to bar manager when I turned <br>twenty-two and since then, I have managed two other bars.</p>
	<p>As much as I loved the bar business, the hours were long and demanding and the unique work schedule has affected my ability to spend time with friends and family. This, in addition to another reason, are what attracted me to Coding Temple.</p>
	<p>Although my coding and programming skills are near none, I feel very comfortable working in front of and with a computer. I also have enjoyed the challenge of solving even the basic Python problems and figuring out HTML and CSS.</p>
	<p>My hobbies and interests mostly consist of cooking, working out, and playing video games. All of which are better with family and friends!</p>
	<p>Thanks for taking the time to learn a bit more about me! Further down you'll find more information about a few, very special people in my life along with a comment and questions box! Feel free to ask anything!</p>

	Mom and Dad
	</h2>
	<p>Family is incredibly important to me and who knows where I would be without my wonderful parents.</p>
	<p>My dad is from New York City. He ran away from home at age 17 to join the Coast Guard. He later switched to the Marine Corps where he finished his career with 30 years of active duty service.</p>
	<p>Despite having a more serious career, my father is one of the most hilarious people I know and is always there for me, no matter what. He is my confidant and best friend.</p>
	<p>My mom is quite literally, a <b>SAINT</b>. She is the most loving and selfless person I know. Her love is best summed up as unconditional.</p>
	<p>Mom is from the Philippines and as such, she had minimal opportunities growing up. However, that only served to have her encourage me to pursue any and every possibility available. She is my biggest supporter.</p>
	<p>Thanks to my parents' diverse upbringings, I have been fortunate enough to see multiple parts of the world along with the different living <br>conditions.</p>
	<p>I have spent holidays and vacations in New York City and Palm Beach, as well as in rural, impoverished provinces in the Philippines.</p>
	<p>My parents mean the world to me, especially as I grow older, and I just wanted to share a bit about them.</p>
	<p>They also live on the other side of town from me so they may stop in to check on me during class one day!</p>

	Cassidy
	</h3>
	<p>Cassidy is my lovely girlfriend.</p>
	<p>She is one of the most determined and hardworking people I have ever met.</p>
	<p>She is the other reason behind me taking the step and signing up for this course. She has been nothing but supportive of my goals and decisions.</p>
	<p>I could go on about her for days but it would neither do her justice nor do I think you all would care to hear every wonderful detail about her.</p>
	<p>I will close out her section with a quote from F. Scott Fitzgerald to his wife, Zelda:</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 10px"><i>“You are the finest, loveliest, tenderest, and most beautiful person I have ever known, but even that is an understatement.”</i></p>
